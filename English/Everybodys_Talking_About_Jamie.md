`Jamie`
```
<p>The drag queens in the olden days...they weren't just queens.</p>
<p>They were warrior queens.</p>
<p>I thought I'd got it hard.</p>
<p>They had the whole world against them and they still never backed down, and me...</p>
<p>I just wanna dance round and show off and be a bit famous.</p>

<p>Drag...it's not just a TV show.
It is a revolution.</p>
```

`Pritti`

<p>So go...join the revolution.</p>

`Jamie`

<p>I'm not even halfway brave enough for that. </p>
<p>Some of them died. Like literally, they died.</p>
<p>And the rest of them still kept on fighting.</p>

`Pritti`

<p>What do you think they were fighting for?
<p>For the future.</p>
<p>And that's you.</p>
<p>This is how you honour them.</p>
<p>By picking up their torch and passing it on.</p>
