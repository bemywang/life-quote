# Everybody's Talking About Jamie


::: warning
*Jamie*
:::

The drag queens in the olden days, they weren't just queens. They were warrior queens.

I thought I'd got it hard.
They had the whole world against them and they still never backed down, and me...
I just wanna dance round and show off and be a bit famous.

Drag...it's not just a TV show.
It is a revolution.

Pritti:
So go...join the revolution.

Jamie:
I'm not even halfway brave enough for that. Some of them died. Like literally, they died.
And the rest of them still kept on fighting.

Pritti:
What do you think they were fighting for?
For the future.
And that's you.
This is how you honour them.
By picking up their torch and passing it on.
